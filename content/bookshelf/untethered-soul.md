## I. Brief Summary
A beautiful book about “you are not your thoughts.” This made me more aware of how my inner voice operates and how I can overcome it. Singer simplifies what it means to live a spiritual life. A practical book on spirituality and how to overcome inner voice which is constantly yapping away.

## II. Big Ideas
- View the thoughts in your mind as a friend on the sofa. You wouldn’t tolerate constant unhealthy chatter from them, why accept it from your mind? 
- You are not your thoughts.

## III. Quotes
- You see, you can’t fail at this because your “self” is what you are, at all times and in all places. We simply need to sort it out. After all, it can get quite confusing in there.
- And should you choose to devote yourself to the ongoing journey of self-realization, you will develop a tremendous sense of respect for who you really are. It is only then that you will come to appreciate the full depth of meaning in the advice: “This above all: to thine own self be true.”
- Notice that the voice takes both sides of the conversation. It doesn’t care which side it takes, just as long as it gets to keep on talking.
- Why do you even tolerate that voice talking to you all the time?
- If you spend some time observing this mental voice, the first thing you will notice is that it never shuts up. When left to its own, it just talks.
- The same is true for the voice inside your head. Why is it talking? It’s you who’s talking, and it’s you who’s listening. And when the voice argues with itself, who is it arguing with? Who could possibly win? It gets very confusing.
- It’s actually a shocking realization when you first notice that your mind is constantly talking.
- The best way to free yourself from this incessant chatter is to step back and view it objectively.
- No matter what the voice is saying, it’s all the same. It doesn’t matter if it’s saying nice things or mean things, worldly things or spiritual things. It doesn’t matter because it’s still just a voice talking inside your head.
- There is nothing more important to true growth than realizing that you are not the voice of the mind—you are the one who hears it.
- People go through so many changes in the name of “trying to find myself.” They want to discover which of these voices, which of these aspects of their personality, is who they really are. The answer is simple: none of them.
- If you watch it objectively, you will come to see that much of what the voice says is meaningless.
- The truth is that most of life will unfold in accordance with forces far outside your control, regardless of what your mind says about it.
- Your thoughts have far less impact on this world than you would like to think.
- If you spend your time hoping that it doesn’t rain tomorrow, you are wasting your time. Your thoughts don’t change the rain.
- Eventually you will see that the real cause of problems is not life itself. It’s the commotion the mind makes about life that really causes problems.
- If so much of what the voice says is meaningless and unnecessary, then why does it even exist? ... there’s a buildup of energy inside that needs to be released. If you watch objectively, you will see that when there’s a buildup of nervous, fearful, or desire-based energies inside, the voice becomes extremely active. That voice talks because you’re not okay inside, and talking releases energy.
- This inner world is an alternate environment that is under your control. The outside world, however, marches to its own laws.
- For example, there are myriad things that you see at any given moment, yet you only narrate a few of them. The ones you discuss in your mind are the ones that matter to you.
- Your consciousness is actually experiencing your mental model of reality, not reality itself.
- You’re walking outside in the winter, you start to shiver, and the voice says, “It’s cold!” Now how did that help you?
- This world is unfolding and really has very little to do with you or your thoughts. It was here long before you came, and it will be here long after you leave. In the name of attempting to hold the world together, you’re really just trying to hold yourself together.
- If used properly, the same mental voice that has been a source of worry, distraction, and general neurosis can become the launching ground for true spiritual awakening.
- Come to know the one who watches the voice, and you will come to know one of the great mysteries of creation.
