## I. Brief Summary
A book on investment legends. William Green is a well-known financial journalist and has access to many of the world's best investors. He shares lessons learned from his interviews of superinvestors. The book is filled with gems of wisdom and clonable concepts. If emulating these investors to become rich is nice in theory but tough to execute, emulating the way they live to become happy might not work even in theory because of their cold and difficult personalities. Nonetheless, the lessons can be fine tuned to lead a great investing and personal life.

## II. Big Ideas
- Many of the investors talk about how they have created systems to mitigate risk but every system is doomed to fail because there is so much randomness that it can drive you insane.
- The lessons shared can also be conflicting because some invest almost all of their money in just a few stocks, but that’s contrary to the advice given by Benjamin Graham (value investor legend), who says diversification is key.
- Investors covererd in this book:
    - **Sir John Templeton**: 
        - Templeton bought stock in 104 U.S. companies, trading at $1 or less, in 1939 at the brink of WWII based on the theory that companies would see huge demand if war broke out. He invested $100 per stock. He made money on 100 out of 104 stocks—a total of 5x his money. Templeton shorted 84 internet stocks, selling at triple its IPO price during the Dotcom Bubble on the theory that insiders would dump their shares after the lockup period ended. He bet $2.2 million on each stock ($185 million total) and made $90 million when the bubble burst. His strategy was to place short bets 7 days before the lockup expiration and cover the bets 10 days after expiration. He also had a rule in place to cover if the stocks rose a certain amount (to protect from excessive losses).
        - You have to buy at a time when other people are desperately trying to sell.
        - It’s a human failing to even put your mind on a question of which stock market is going to go up or down. No one knows that.
        - Six Guiding Principles:
            - Beware of emotions. 
                - Most people get led astray by emotions in investing. They get led astray by being excessively careless and optimistic when they have big profits, and by getting excessively pessimistic and too cautious when they have big losses. 
                - To buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are enthusiastically buying is the most difficult. But it pays the greatest rewards.
            - Beware of your own ignorance.
                - So many people buy something with the tiniest amount of information. They don't really understand what it is that they are buying. The one with the greatest information is likely to come out ahead. It takes a huge amount of work and study and investigation. Templeton claimed that diligence had played a much greater role in his success than innate talent.
                - He often spoke of his determination to give the extra ounce - to make the extra call, to schedule the extra meeting, to take the extra research trip. He was similarly dedicated to his lifelong programme of continuous self-education.
            - You should diversify broadly to protect yourself from your own fallibility.
                - Investing is so difficult, that even the best investors should assume that they'll be right no more than two-thirds of the time, however hard they work.
            - Invest in a company only if it falls within your circle of competence.
            - The best way to find bargains is to study whichever assets have performed most dismally in the past five years, then to assess whether the cause of those woes is temporary or permanent.
                - Most people are naturally drawn to investments that are already successful. Templeton took the opposite approach asking "Where is the outlook worst?"
            - One of the most important things for an investor is not to chase fads.
                - The best way for an investor to avoid popular delusions is to focus not on outlook but on value.
    - **Irving Kahn**
        - Investing is about preserving more than anything.
        - Considering the downside is the single most important thing an investor must do. This task must be dealt with before any consideration can be made for gains.
        - If you achieve only reasonable returns and suffer minimal losses, you will become a wealthy man and will surpass any gambler friends you may have. This is also a good way to cure your sleeping problems.
    - **Bill Ruane**:
        - He learned his investing principles from Albert Hettinger.
        - Do not borrow money to buy stocks. You don't act rationally when you're investing borrowed money.
        - Watch out for momentum. Proceed with extreme caution “when you see markets going crazy”, either because the herd is panicking or charging into stocks at irrational valuations.
        - Ignore market predictions: I firmly believe that nobody knows the market will do....The important thing is to find an attractive idea and invest in a company that's cheap.
        - Invest in a small number of stocks that you have researched so intensively that you have an informational advantage. I don’t know anybody who can really do a good job investing in a lot of stocks except Peter Lynch. It was the most important principle for Ruane, according to Green.
        - You don’t act rationally when you’re investing borrowed money.
        - Most people would be much better off with an index fund.
    - **Marty Whitman**
    - **Jack Bogle**
        - Don’t take excessive risk.
        - Keep your costs low.
        - The crowd is always wrong.
    - **Charlie Munger**
        - Avoid stupidity. Other people are trying to be smart. All I’m trying to be is non-idiotic.
        - Common errors:
            - Listening to market predictions.
            - Buying cyclicals at the top of the cycle or poor businesses at market tops.
            - Being close-minded.
            - Doing things because “other people do it.”
            - Rush to decisions.
            - Ego, overconfidence, overoptimism.
        - If you would persuade, appeal to interest and not to reason. This maxim is a wise guide to a great and simple precaution in life: Never, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives.
        - A systematic process of studying counterarguments, taking a devil’s advocate approach, or writing premortems (assuming disaster) are ways to limit biases and improve decisions.
        - Lists of your biggest biases, emotional tendencies, and mistakes serve as a good checklist before making a decision.
        - If you’re going to be in this game for the long pull, which is the way to do it, you better be able to handle a fifty percent decline without fussing too much about it. And so my lesson to all of you is, conduct your life so that you can handle the fifty percent decline with grace.
        - You have to be like a man standing with a spear next to a stream. Most of the time he’s doing nothing. When a fat juicy salmon swims by, the man spears it. Then he goes back to doing nothing. It may be six months before the next salmon goes by.
    - **Ed Thorp**
        - As far as gambling is concerned, if I don’t have an edge, I don’t play.
        - He heavily relied on the Kelly Criterion to size positions.
        - Had a chance to invest in LTCM but passed because they were taking too much risk....So the probability of their ruin appeared substantial to me.

## III. Quotes
- Everything is on a path to fade. — Matthew McLennan
- Most people make the mistake of adding too much complexity to their lives. They skim the surface, preoccupying themselves with the superficial and the extraneous. As the best investors show, sustained excellence requires us to subtract and go deep.
- If you’re going to be in this game for the long pull, which is the way to do it, you better be able to handle a fifty percent decline without fussing too much about it. And so my lesson to all of you is, conduct your life so that you can handle the fifty percent decline with aplomb and grace. Don’t try to avoid it. It will come. In fact, I would say if it doesn’t come, you’re not being aggressive enough.
- Munger has also learned to control certain toxic emotions that would corrode his enjoyment of life. “Crazy anger. Crazy resentment. Avoid all that stuff,” he tells me. “I don’t let it run. I don’t let it start.” The same goes for envy, which he considers the dumbest of the seven deadly sins because it’s not even fun. He also disdains the tendency to view oneself as a victim, and he has no patience for whining. When I ask if he has a mental process that helps him to defuse self-defeating emotions, he replies, “I know that anger is stupid. I know that resentment is stupid. I know self-pity is stupid. So I don’t do them....I’m trying not to be stupid every day, all day.
- You get a lot of A’s and B’s in school. In the stock market, you get a lot of F’s. And if you’re right six or seven times out of ten, you’re very good.
- All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.
- I feel wealthier not because I have more money but because I’ve got health, good friendships, I’ve got a great family. Prosperity takes all of these things into consideration: health, wealth, happiness, peace of mind. That’s what a prosperous person is, not just a lot of money. That doesn’t mean anything. – Van Den Berg
- If all you succeed in doing in life is getting rich by buying little pieces of paper, it’s a failed life. Life is more than being shrewd in wealth accumulation. — Charlie Munger
- It’s frightening to think that you might not know something, but more frightening to think that, by and large, the world is run by people who have faith that they know exactly what’s going on.
- If you just go around and identify all of the disasters and say, ‘What caused that?’ and try to avoid it, it turns out to be a very simple way to find opportunities and avoid troubles.
- I don’t have any wonderful insights that other people don’t have. I just have slightly more consistently than others avoided idiocy. Other people are trying to be smart. All I’m trying to be is non-idiotic. I find that all you have to do to get ahead in life is to be non-idiotic and live a long time. It’s harder to be non-idiotic than most people think.
- Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life. Think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.
- The Art of Subtraction—If there is one habit that all of the investors in this chapter have in common, it’s this: They focus almost exclusively on what they’re best at and what matters most to them. Their success derives from this fierce insistence on concentrating deeply in a relatively narrow area while disregarding countless distractions that could interfere with their pursuit of excellence. Jason Zweig, an old friend who is a personal finance columnist at the Wall Street Journal and the editor of a revised edition of The Intelligent Investor, once wrote to me, “Think of Munger and Miller and Buffett: guys who just won’t spend a minute of time or an iota of mental energy doing or thinking about anything that doesn’t make them better....Their skill is self-honesty. They don’t lie to themselves about what they are and aren’t good at. Being honest with yourself like that has to be part of the secret. It’s so hard and so painful to do, but so important.
- Once you have a sense that life is meaningless, what should you do? Not fuck up life for other people. Leave the planet a better place than you found it. Do a good job with your kids. The rest of it is a game. It doesn’t matter.
- The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.
- How to prepare for the future instead of fooling ourselves into believing we can predict it.
- In a world where nothing is stable or dependable and almost anything can happen, the first rule of the road is to be honest with ourselves about our limitations and vulnerabilities.
- Fragility comes in many forms.
- The ideal amount to give your kids is enough so they can do anything, but not so much that they can do nothing.
- Templeton, Soros, and Buffett share “the willingness to be lonely, the willingness to take a position that others don’t think is too bright. They have an inner conviction that a lot of people do not have.”– Michael Lipper
- A necessary characteristic of great investors is that they can’t be overly influenced by what other people think. The easiest way not to be overly influenced by what other people think is not to be that aware of what they think. If you don’t really notice that and don’t really care about what other people think, that will make it easier to be a great investor. — Chris Davis
- If you’re even a slightly above average investor who spends less than you earn, over a lifetime you cannot help but get very wealthy. — Buffett
- You don’t have to swing at everything—you can wait for your pitch. The problem when you’re a money manager is that your fans keep yelling, ‘Swing, you bum!’ — Warren Buffett
- We, and our judgment, and all mortal things go on flowing and rolling unceasingly. Thus nothing certain can be established about one thing by another, both the judging and the judged being in continual change. — Michel De Montaigne
- The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook. — William James
- To attain knowledge, add things every day. To attain wisdom, subtract things every day. — Lao-tzu
- Uncertainty compels diversification. Diversification is and always has been the first tenet of the Prudent Man Rule of Investing....In sub-Saharan Africa, for centuries, people believed cattle were the safest repository of wealth. That was until the great drought came along. — Barton Biggs
- The stock market is a sadistic, contrary, changeable beast and nothing is forever. — Barton Biggs
- The crucial question is whether the investor will, in fact, hold on. The problem is not in the market, but in ourselves, our perceptions, and our reactions to our perceptions. This is why it is so important for each client to develop a realistic knowledge of his own and/or his organization’s tolerance for market fluctuations. — Charles Ellis
- The only thing we can really count on in this uncertain world is human unreliability itself. — Garrett Harden
