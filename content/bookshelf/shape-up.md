## I. Brief Summary
A book on how Basecamp (one of my favorite organizations with inspirational founders) does software and product development. Ryan Singer introduces new vocabulary to shift the mindset—shaping, appetite, bread-boarding, scopes and uphill and downhill phases of work. These are great concepts to understand which can make software and product development process effective in any organization.

## II. Big Ideas
- Shaping
    - Hammer your tasks to have the right level of abstractions, not leaving big rabbit holes, but being open enough to let design and developers work.
    - Break your project to fit the cycles, not the cycles to fit your projects/tasks.
    - Work with projects! (No tasks backlogs, no Business Point and Implementation points) One project with one final goal. The operation will break it.
- Executing
    - Divide the whole project into scopes (small visible and concrete part of the implementation)
    - Start from the most uncertainty part and build around it.
    - Work vertically to deliver something concrete and actionable. (Build the core and then refine it)
    - Give status update a few days after the cycle began and do it asynchronous! 

## III. Quotes
- We don’t do daily stand-ups, design sprints, development sprints, or anything remotely tied to a metaphor that includes being tired and worn out at the end.
- Estimates start with a design and end with a number. Appetite starts with a number and ends with a design.
- Beware the simple question: Is this possible? In software everything is possible, but nothing is free.
