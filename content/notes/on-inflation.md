The US budget is at a concerning state as deficits are out of control. A deficit occurs when the federal government’s spending exceeds its revenues. As of July 2024, the federal government has spent $1.27 trillion more than it has collected resulting in a national deficit. Majority of tax receipts are also eaten up by interest payments. 

A deeper investigation is required in understanding how inflation can ruin current progress. We should investigate if it is a political phenomenon, central bank phenomenon, or both? To what extent are interest payments eating up the national income? What major factors are contributing towards inflation? Which political party has caused the most deficits? What major events caused further inflation? What must be done to fix inflation? Why does a government operate this way when no household or a business operate this uncontrollable way?

Let's review the basics of two governments that are responsible for inflation.

Remember, who can print money? *Federal Reserve Board* which is the Central Bank of US.

What can they do with money? To purchase financial assets such as bonds.

Why do they do that? To support federal budget and the economic needs for *US Government*.

The US Government can buy goods and services and put money in hands of people. But when the government is in deficit, they can create coupons which is then purchased by the Central Bank to fund the spending needs of US government.

This is how both governments balance their monetary (the Central Bank) and fiscal policy (the US Government) out.

Inflation occurs when the quantity of money increases faster than the quantity of goods. Why does the money supply increase? It does so to enable the government to pay its bills without raising taxes. 

This causes psychological effect on people making them feel richer while the government debt grows. This is why it is difficult for government to reduce spending and print less money because this can cause recession and double-digit inflation.

One might also think the primary cause for inflation is supply and demand. The Central Bank has another tool in its arsenal which is managing interest rates to control the cost of money. The Central Bank can increase interest rates (cost of money) when the demand is high and reduce interest rates when the demand is low. This in turn would control prices and production of goods and services.

When demand goes up everywhere, you'll have to pay more everywhere else. This is when Central Bank steps in by increasing rates. If people feel the burden of prices they would consider reducing their spending bringing the equilibrium in prices and balancing supply and demand. And same policy can be deployed by reducing interest rates when demand is low.

But no matter what the cause of inflation, it is not good for its people. Inflation pays off government debt. But inflation is a tax on its people. Your purchasing power (money sitting in the bank) will always be eaten up by inflation. 

The US government continues to finance its deficits by inflation which causes great prosperity for acting government but a great distress on its people.

A deeper dive is required to understand the entire phenomenon.

## Cycles

The deflationary cycle needs to be balanced with the inflationary cycle in order to maintain stability. The right balance requires a certain mix of spending cuts, reducing debt, transferring wealth and printing money so that economic and social stability can be maintained. Let's review both cycles.

### Inflationary cycle

As economic activity increases, we see an expansion cycle. Spending continues to increase and prices start to rise. 

This happens because the increase in spending is fueled by credit which can be created instantly out of thin air.

Prices rise when the amount of spending grow faster than the production of goods. 

When prices rise, we call this inflation.

### Deflationary cycle

The opposite is deflation. It occurs when prices fall. If economic activity is decreasing rapidly, inflation is no longer a threat.  

Deflation can happen due to several reasons—exports (for example, goods from China), innovation (for example, prices in TV sets overtime) or lower wages.

Manufacturers slow down production. Lower production means unemployment. As prices fall and jobs are lost, people put off purchases. The stock market crashes. As economic crisis loom, government lose tax revenue. 

A severe decrease in economic activity for a few or several consecutive quarters will cause a recession or a depression. For example, deflation helped turn the 1929 recession into the Great Depression.

## Policies

Government policy is expressed through its borrowing and spending activities. The two types of government policy that contributes towards economy activity are—fiscal policy and monetary policy. The primary goal of both monetary and fiscal policy is the creation of a well-balanced economic environment where growth is stable and positive and inflation is stable and low. Both are used to regulate economic activity over time.
