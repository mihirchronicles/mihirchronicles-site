A risky time for the US budget as deficits are out of control. A deficit occurs when the federal governmentâ€™s spending exceeds its revenues. As of July 2024, the federal government has spent $1.27 trillion more than it has collected resulting in a national deficit. Majority of tax receipts are also eaten up by interest payments. 

A deeper investigation is required in understanding how inflation can ruin current progress. We should investigate if it is a political phenomenon, central bank phenomenon, or both? To what extent are interest payments eating up the national income? What major factors are contributing towards inflation? Which political party has caused the most deficits? What major events caused further inflation? What must be done to fix inflation? Why does a government operate this way when no household or a business operate this uncontrollable way?

Let's review the basics of two governments that are responsible for inflation.

Remember, who can print money? *Federal Reserve Board* which is the Central Bank of US.

What can they do with money? To purchase financial assets such as bonds.

Why do they do that? To support federal budget and the economic needs for *US Government*.

The US Government can buy goods and services and put money in hands of people. But when the government is in deficit, they can create coupons which is then purchased by the Central Bank to fund the spending needs of US government.

This is how both governments balance their monetary (the Central Bank) and fiscal policy (the US Government) out.

Inflation occurs when the quantity of money increases faster than the quantity of goods. Why does the money supply increase? It does so to enable the government to pay its bills without raising taxes. 

This causes psychological effect on people making them feel richer while the government debt grows. This is why it is difficult for government to reduce spending and print less money because this can cause recession and double-digit inflation.

One might also think the primary cause for inflation is supply and demand. The Central Bank has another tool in its arsenal which is managing interest rates to control the cost of money. The Central Bank can increase interest rates (cost of money) when the demand is high and reduce interest rates when the demand is low. This in turn would control prices and production of goods and services.

When demand goes up everywhere, you'll have to pay more everywhere else. This is when Central Bank steps in by increasing rates. If people feel the burden of prices they would consider reducing their spending bringing the equilibrium in prices and balancing supply and demand. And same policy can be deployed by reducing interest rates when demand is low.

But no matter what the cause of inflation, it is not good for its people. Inflation pays off government debt. But inflation is a tax on its people. Your purchasing power (money sitting in the bank) will always be eaten up by inflation. 

The US government continues to finance its deficits by inflation which causes great prosperity for acting government but a great distress on its people.

A deeper dive is required to understand the entire phenomenon.
