A risky time for the US budget as deficits are out of control (TBD). Majority of tax receipts are eaten up by interest payments (TBD). Is it a political phenomenon, central bank phenomenon, or both?

Let's investigate on how this is expected to work.

Remember, who can print money? THE CENTRAL BANK–FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD.

What can they do with money? To purchase financial assets such as bonds.

Why do they do that? To support and balance the economic needs for THE US GOVERNMENT. 

The US Government can buy goods and services and put money in hands of people. But when the government is in deficit, they can create coupons which is then purchased by the Central Bank to fund the spending needs of US government.

This is how both governments balance their monetary (the Central Bank) and fiscal policy (the US Government) out.

Are there any alternative ways to meet the spending need of a functioning government? 

1. You can reduce debt by cutting spending.
2. You can increase taxation on wealthy individuals to pay off the debt.
3. You can increase taxation for all tax brackets to meet the demand for spending need and debt management.
4. Or you can print money…out of thin air.

Unlike the option 1-3, printing money is inflationary. This is why money supply is the major cause for inflation.

Inflation occurs when the quantity of money increases faster than the quantity of goods. Why does the money supply increase? It does so to enable the government to pay its bills without raising taxes. People feel richer while the government debt grows.

There's only one real cure for inflation. It is a cure that's easy to describe but difficult to apply—the government must reduce spending and print less money. However, this can cause recession and double-digit inflation.

One might think the primary cause for inflation is supply and demand. This is why the Central Bank deploys monetary policy of managing interest rates to control the prices. The Central Bank controls the cost of money.

When demand goes up everywhere, you'll have to pay more everywhere else. This is why you aren't better off with your purchasing power. Your purchasing power (money sitting in the bank) will be eaten up by inflation. 

Inflation pays off government debt. But inflation is a tax on its people. The US government continues to finance its deficits by inflation.

Inflation causes great prosperity for acting government but a great distress on its people.

Inflation is a disease caused by government.
