Objective Key Results (OKR)—a goal setting framework that was popularized in Silicon Valley has been widely adopted beyond the West Coast. OKR has been a better part of my professional journey, but the implementation of the methodology has always been messy because they do not cascade through the entire organization as they are intended to.

This led me to study the topic from the father of OKR who came up with the methodology—John Doer.

> A lot of companies create organization-wide objectives, but they don’t translate them down into personal OKRs. That’s right — and creating that cascade is one of the powerful parts of the system. The book says that there are four superpowers. On reflection, I think there are really five benefits that you get out of this. Focus is the first, because these are limited in number. Alignment is the one you’re talking about — you get everybody aligned. Commitment is third. When you’ve transparently set these goals, and all your colleagues see them, commitment clears that up quickly. And then the fourth superpower is tracking the progress. This is why Bill Gates uses the system at the Gates Foundation. Then the fifth superpower is stretching. Larry Page of Google is the high priest of 10x-ing everything, stretching further. He’ll say, I’d rather have the objective be to go to Mars, and if we fall short, we’ll get to the moon. This is how you make moonshots. Focus, alignment, commitment, tracking and stretching, I love that because it spells FACTS. And I can remember it. How do OKRs differ from, or complement, an Agile system? Agile guides your day-to-day work. OKRs don’t govern your day-to-day behavior. I’d say this is more of a weekly check-in. But it’s not set the goals and then stuff them away in a drawer and ignore them. People really care whether or not the CEO is watching their goals or cheering them on. If a leader wants a way to reach down into an organization, this is a great tool for doing it. You even use OKRs in your personal life? Yes, it can work against any agenda. I have had a set of personal objectives and key results. Most of mine have been around family. Now both daughters are off to school, but years ago I read and believed that having family dinners together was a key to having a happy family. So my key result was to get home for dinner by 6PM at least 20 nights a month, and be present, with our phones in another room. And that’s pretty hard to do. I was living in the 70% threshold is a good result — that would mean 14 or 15 nights a month. That’s an example of how OKRs can span any range of human activity. They’re transparent vessels that describe the “what” and the “how.” The values we pour into those vessels are the answers for the question, “Why?” — John Doer

If implemented right, OKRs can drive 5 things—focus, alignment, commitment, tracking progress and stretching (FACTS).

OKRs are not perfect. In the absence of strong leadership or the absence of a visionary leader, the entire organization could be working on wrong things if objectives are not bold enough for the business. OKRs also do not allow for what isn't under your control. Self-worth is tied into objective and key results, but the individual does not have full control over its environment. A system is equally responsible for failure to meet its objective.

Nonetheless, OKRs are valuable in driving focus for the entire organization. 

## Background

John Doerr is the father of OKR who is responsible for bringing OKRs to Google and the world. He transformed Andy Grove's managerial system from Intel and made the process formal through OKR. Andy Grove was best known for driving operational excellence at Intel during its peak. Following were Grove's managerial philosophy:

- Less is more–each objective should be tied to no more than five key results.
- Set goals from the bottom up—when teams and individuals set their own OKRs, they tend to stay more motivated.
- No dictating—OKRs are “a cooperative social contract,” so there should always be space for debating and negotiations.
- Stay flexible–in a fast changing environment, objectives can stop being relevant, so it should always be easy to modify them, together with the key results.
- Dare to fail—some OKRs should be uncomfortable, even unattainable, which means you’d need to be ready to fail.
- A tool, not a weapon—OKRs are not legal documents according to which you’re expected to measure your performance.
- Be patient—it’s next to impossible to fully understand the mechanism of the system in one cycle. You may need up to five quarterly cycles to see how this actually works.

## Definition 

OKR is short for Objective and Key Results. Both are collaboratively driven by an entire organization to execute on the vision and strategic goals.

- **Objective**: answers the WHAT is to be achieved.
- **Key Results**: answers the HOW is it going to be achieved.

If implemented correctly, it drives focus and transparency while eliminating conflicting priorities. 

An illustrative example of OKRs in an organization:

**CEO**
- Objective: gain ice-cream market share in Chicago.
- Key Results: sell 5000 pallets of vanilla ice-cream a week.

**Head of Manufacturing**
- Objective: produce 5000 pallets of vanilla ice-cream a week.
- Key Result: make 150,000 gallons of vanilla ice-cream a week.

**Head of Sales**
- Objective: sell 5000 pallets of vanilla ice-cream a week.
- Key Result 1: create a referral program to achieve >90% brand recommendation from existing buyers.
- Key Result 2: create a brand promotion with summer camp organizations to sell ice-cream during games.

This is a simple example of OKR in action. It ties back into CEO's objective which cascades down to every business unit. 

The secret sauce of OKRs is in the Key Results. 

Performance should be measured by results (note, not tied to employee compensation). Each key result is measurable and verifiable. This is the best way to align incentives. Results should be regularly updated every quarter. If results are not achieved within a defined timeframe, it is time to reassess.

A key point to remember—progress should be measured by outcome not an output otherwise goals are up for gamification. For example, Wells Fargo's organization goals led personal bankers to open fake customer accounts to meet the quota. Key results should be intentional.

Lastly, the goal is not to create a feature factory machine, but to solve a business problem and create organizational value. If organization is structured and aligned correctly, OKRs can be extremely effective by ensuring all members of the organization are working toward the same goals.

## Facts

The 5 superpowers of OKRs—focus, alignment, commitment, tracking progress and stretching.

- Focus—the organization on what matters which concern things that are supposed to be done for the company to survive and function (like delivering a feature by a set date).
- Align—openly shared OKRs link individual goals to the company’s game plan and identify cross-team dependencies that require collaboration. For sound decision-making, and superior performance, top-line goals must be clearly understood throughout the organization.
- Commitment—committed objectives are supposed to be fully (100%) achieved within a specific time limit.
- Track for accountability—OKRs are driven by data and animated by periodic check-ins with objective grading, done in a spirit of no-judgment accountability. Google scores on 0 to 1.0 system: 
	- 0.7 to 1.0 is green
	- 0.4 to 0.6 is yellow
	- 0.0 to 0.3 is red
- Stretch your goals—aspirational objectives are those that go beyond your everyday routine and are more about your vision of the company’s future. They are not always attainable, but necessary for management and contributors to challenge themselves. Bill Campbell liked to say, “If companies don’t continue to innovate, they’re going to die—and I didn’t say iterate , I said innovate.”

## Continuous performance management

> Feedback is an opinion, grounded in observations and experiences, which allows us to know what impression we make on others. — Sheryl Sandberg

Objectives set the context for Continuous Performance Management (CFR). CFRs help promote transparency, accountability, empowerment, and teamwork. 

- Conversations: an authentic, richly textured exchange between manager and contributor, aimed at driving performance.
- Feedback: bidirectional or networked communication among peers to evaluate progress and guide future improvement. Look for specific feedback which is self-driven insight. “We are constantly surrounded by positive reinforcement and feedback, but many of us haven’t been trained to seek it out. Say you give a presentation to your team. After the fact, somebody comes up to you and says, ‘Hey, nice job.’ Most of us would say, ‘Oh great, thanks,’ and move on. But we want to probe a little deeper: ‘Thank you. What one thing did you like about it?’ The idea is to capture more specific feedback in real time.”
- Recognition: expressions of appreciation to deserving individuals for contributions of all sizes.

## Relationship between OKRs and culture

Culture eats strategy for breakfast. OKRs are perfectly setup to achieve that meal.

> Culture is a set of values and beliefs, as well as familiarity with the way things are done and should be done in a company. The point is that a strong and positive corporate culture is absolutely essential. — Andy Grove

A culture that drives focus, alignment and meaning will always win. If an organization believes the work they are doing, members of the organization will feel empowered and motivated to show up. OKRs should be set in a way that support the following:

- Structure and clarity: are goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear? 
- Psychological safety: can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed? 
- Meaning of work: are we working on something that is personally important for each of us? 
- Dependability: can we count on each other to do high-quality work on time? 
- Impact of work: do we fundamentally believe that the work we’re doing matters?
