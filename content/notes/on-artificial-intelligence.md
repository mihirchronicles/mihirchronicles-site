_**In Progress**_

Scaling human intelligence and finding the master algorithm has been a shiny problem within the computer science profession for several decades. There is no doubt we are living in the age of AI as all walks of life are being transformed by machine learning and artificial intelligence. We are already seeing the impact of the field on social science including human experience and decision making. 

Here is my attempt to deep dive on the topic of AI without claiming any future predictions.

Bold statements come flying high every second on deeming computers intelligent. Whether they are intelligent enough to save us or kill us, I am not sure, but it is worth exploring the meaning of _intelligence_ before diving deeper into _machines_.

## Human Intelligence

What does it mean to call something intelligent—a human child, computer or an animal?

Cognitive science is a vast field with different dichotomies in intelligence—consciousness, thinking (deliberative vs non-deliberative), reflexive behavior, language (semantic), perception, feelings, thought, common sense, learning (children), comprehension, competence and reasoning and generalization. Intelligence is embodiment of these other complex systems.

Humans are not born pre-programmed with a set of instructions that we deem intelligent. Intelligence is built overtime through repeated tasks with failure and success as a form of feedback. This feedback mechanism shapes our human behavior. 

The counter argument can be made that our DNA is coded with instructions passed to us from our ancestors. But then how can an infant not hold a spoon to feed itself? An extreme example but the point here is even though we are coded with instructions in our DNA learning is necessary to carry out day-to-day tasks. Humans do not experience pre-programmed paradigm like the computers do.

Another thing to note about our environment is the causal relationships—some things make other things happen which enables one to learn how the surroundings work. The cause and effect shapes our  behavior. For example, picking a hot cup of coffee and dropping it on the floor made the carpet wet. Another example is moon affects the tides on our oceans.

The cause and effect is important in science and learning because we analyze data based on experiments. We modify one tiny thing to see what happens. This is how babies learn. They are constantly experimenting by interacting with their environment. Some pre-programming from DNA helps shape personality and behavior, but majority of the learning comes from experimenting constantly which is how they learn.

## Singularity

Is there such a thing called master algorithm that will trump our lives?

## Economic Impact

## Gaps
- Pre-programmed
- Data wall & knowledge box
- Connecting dots for future discovery

## Applications

No doubt integrating AI tools in your daily workflows can increase your productivity by 10x. Lets's explore how.
