_**In Progress**_

Scaling human intelligence and finding the master algorithm has been humanity's mission since dawn. There is no doubt we are living in the age of AI as all walks of life are being transformed by machine learning and artificial intelligence. At this moment it feels like the impact will be many fold on human experience and decision making.

Here is my attempt to deep dive on the topic of AI without claiming any future predictions.

Bold statements come flying high every second on deeming computers being intelligent. Whether they are intelligent enough to save us or kill us, I am not sure, but it is worth exploring what _intelligence_ even means to us before diving deeper into _machines_.

## Human Intelligence

**What does it mean to be intelligent?**

Cognitive science is a vast field with different dichotomies in intelligence—consciousness, thinking (deliberative vs non-deliberative), reflexive behavior, language (semantic), perception, feelings, thought, common sense, learning (children), recollection, comprehension, competence and reasoning and generalization. Intelligence is an embodiment of these other complex systems.

Humans are not born pre-programmed with a set of instructions that we deem intelligent. Many of our other friends in animal kingdom are born and immediately get up and run around. We don't. We sit there for three months looking and listening.  Babies are processing raw ingredients but it may look like we spend a lot of time as babies doing basically nothing.

Though we our not pre-programmed with instructions on how to interact with our surroundings, we do come with pre-programmed genetic code. Our DNA has genetic code which is passed on to us from our ancestors. An infant does not know how to hold a spoon to feed itself when they enter the world, but crying when hungry is in our genetic code. Both intuition and learning are equally critical for survival.

As babies grow into infants, they break into adaptive behavior, language, vocalization and motor skills. They are performing repetitive exercises through which learnings are reinforced. Reward and punishment plays a role in feedback cycle.

The causal relationships—some things make other things happen enable us to learn how the surroundings work. The cause and effect shapes our behavior. For example, picking a hot cup of milk and dropping it on the floor made the carpet wet. Another example is moon affects the tides on our oceans. 

This cause and effect drives feedback loop cycle for infants and toddlers. They modify one tiny thing to see what happens. They are constantly experimenting by interacting with their environment. Some pre-programming from DNA helps shape personality and behavior, but majority of the learning comes from experimenting. This is when they also learn about our cultural norms.

As the learning reinforces through interaction with their environment, motor skills starts to take a shape. For example, motor flexes when taking a hard fall on a playground. It is impossible to instruct a toddler step by step what organs to involve when they get hurt. But human body evolves without too much practice. 

Daniel Dennett, an American philosopher and cognitive scientist called this *competence with comprehension* and *competence without comprehension*. There is a lot of competence in the absence of comprehension within our species.

This brings me to common sense—which is another form of intelligence. It gives us basic assumptions that help us navigate this complex world. Experience and genetics collectively teaches us to do quick inferences. If you have a wider vehicle you know you cannot fit in a narrow alleyway. This is learned by having countless interactions between physical experience, innate repository, thinking and rationalizing. And this combination of complex intelligent systems result in projecting assumptions to other things in life. This general awareness is what we mean by common sense.

This does not even cover all other complexities that shape our intelligence, but using human babies, we can learn intelligence is not formulaic. Our ancestors don't bring us to the world with step-by-step instructions.

**What drives our desire for creating another form of super intelligence?**

As much as we desire a god like control over other species and our surroundings, we are able to fulfill this desire because human species come with curiosity and ability to communicate with language.

No other species have we found thus far that cares deeply about why sky is blue or slowing down the decay of human organs so we can live longer. Our strong desire to learn about the world is what makes us super intelligent which has resulted in complex tooling and machinery. Our innate ability to search and explore is intrinsic because we know how babies operate. They are constantly experimenting, questioning and reasoning. As a parent I wonder how my kid picked things up which were never taught. This is human cognition at its finest.

Then on the other side we use language that is far superior than other species in animal kingdom. I can communicate to my family how I feel. Not only am I able to learn what is going on around me or within me, but I am able to communicate to others about these environments. 

This is what also makes us conscious!

But will each one of my cell care about how I feel? Will it wipe my tears or sing with me when I am joyful? As we know today, at a cellular level that does not happen. But human body as a collective has feelings because we experience it on a daily basis and we react to those emotions accordingly.

Writing all this down using a language on a tool that was built by a co-human is a form of thinking. Able to borrow ideas and repurpose them with my own thoughts and analogies is another form of intelligence. This is what I think separates human intelligence from animal intelligence.

This is my understanding of basic human intelligence. Now let's dive into machine intelligence.
