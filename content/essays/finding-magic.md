A question worth exploring—where do you find your magic? For me, it is the following:

1. Hiking in the mountains
2. Walking and biking on trails surrounded by trees and water
3. Long conversations with my wife
4. Holding philosophical conversations with my mom
5. Spending time with kids—human and pet kid
6. Painting canvases and drawing silly things
7. Listening to Eminem and Ludovico Einaudi
8. Reading books
9. Exploring complex topics by writing about them
10. Meeting folks from random communities and learning about them
11. Organizing physical and digital things
12. Watching basketball
13. Dancing
14. Exploring artists and their work
15. Share my passion about Mungerism and Buffettology with others

None of these go in particular order, but they give me the most energy when I do these things making life feel flawless. A reminder to do more of these, not less.
