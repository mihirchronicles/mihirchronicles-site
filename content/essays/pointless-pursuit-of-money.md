Why do we waste our energy on pointless pursuit of money?

Have you been to social gatherings where people are discussing a trending technology? These conversations are one dimensional because it all leads to brainstorming sessions on how to make more money, but nothing about technology. But everyone seems to be an expert on Artificial Intelligence or Crypto. Once the trending technology fades, the next one begins. Rinse and repeat.

I get easily bored with money. Everyone wants more of it. This human pattern has remained consistent ever since I left college. No matter what background anyone comes from, it seems to be an exciting topic for many people.

We all understand the pointlessness of money yet we pursuit it in life. How much one pursues depends on the socioeconomic status.

The utility of a dollar varies from rich to the poor. Optimizing for a dollar might be pointless for a rich, but valuable for poor. There is a certain threshold that the utility of money is critical, but after a certain point, the utility of money starts declining or becomes flat.

In one of the famous letters, Seneca observes how often powerful people are slaves to their money. Consider the actions we take in order to impress other people or the lengths weâ€™ll go to fulfill urges or state desires which we don't even understand.

More 0s, more weight there is to it. And it is distorting for your kids. 

Money is a tool. It is like calories for your body, and the purpose of a calorie is to fuel your body, so you can perform your daily human tasks. But you don't go to a grocery store to see how many calories you can get, so you can have the most of it. It's a means to an end.

Rate the action of the person, not how deep their pockets are. 

Money does not define an arbitrary rating of human value. Humans have soul. Don't let money hijack your focus.

Money is a required pursuit in life, but pointless upon death.
