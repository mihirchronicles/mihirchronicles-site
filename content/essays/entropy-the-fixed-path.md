There used to be fewer problems at work. What is happening?

Life used to be simple. What happened?

The wheel of time goes through its natural cycle—creation to destruction to rebirth, but we continue to fight the decay brought on by entropy.

Entropy is the second law of thermodynamics. It states that entropy—the measure of disorder in a closed system is always increasing.

Everything has a default state and energy will move to its non-default state. The universe is always drifting from a state of order to a state of disorder.

The birth of a child (default state) to turning a 30-year-old getting married (non-default state). The start of a company with 1 employee (default state) to a 300 people organization (non-default state). This is why the only constant in life is change. 

Yes, things used to be simple, but things are now chaotic because entropy is always increasing resulting in complexity.

If chaos is the law of nature then order is the dream of humanity. Order does not create growth, chaos does. 

Befriend entropy, don't fight it.

Complexity is not an accident. It is the byproduct of a universal law—the second law of thermodynamics. You and I are both decaying and declining from our original state. The path is fixed.
