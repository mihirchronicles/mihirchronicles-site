Life is not fair, but that is how it goes. And, this is one rule I am absolutely sure about because every stage of life has presented me with this fact. As the saying goes, “You are always going to meet someone in life who's smarter, richer, or better looking.”

Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, a Russian writer, who did not agree with Soviet ideology, once said, “Human beings are born with different capacities. If they are free, they are not equal. And if they are equal, they are not free.”

Another prominent writer Kurt Vonnegut Jr. once said in his book Harrison Bergeron, “The year was 2081, and everybody was finally equal. They weren't only equal before God and the law. They were equal every which way. Nobody was smarter than anybody else. Nobody was better looking than anybody else. Nobody was stronger or quicker than anybody else. All this equality was due to the 211th, 212th, and 213th Amendments to the Constitution, and to the unceasing vigilance of agents of the United States Handicapper General.”

This can be unsettling to a society that aims for radical equality, but this defeats the purpose of diversity. Opportunities are never equal. I am not sure why the concept of fairness applies to us humans, but I have come to a conclusion that is not how our environment works or is intended to work.
 
Everyone’s got an unfair disadvantage, and you should accept that fact of life. But this can benefit you if you shift your perspective.

Making your unfair advantage (natural talent) count. We all have something special in us, so we should use that to our advantage. It all comes down to what we choose and how we choose to respond. Viktor E. Frankl, a Holocaust survivor once said, “Between stimulus and response there is space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.”

You should know what your natural talents are. If you don't, spend time on exploring and discovering them. If you explore far and deep enough, you will stumble upon something that you truly enjoy. There are many ways to get started.

See why people come to you. My wife is good at listening. People find comfort in her.

See what you are naturally drawn to. I recently discovered the joy and talent for art. It took Covid lockdown for me to realize that.

See what comes easy to you which is harder for others. Aiming for effortlessness is far greater than aiming for friction. Success can come from both. I can read for hours without feeling like it is hard work.

Life gets a lot easier when you surrender to your natural gifts and talents. This allows you to live the life that you want to live in.

Embracing your unfair advantage is where the magic lies for your success.

Follow the wisdom of Phil Knight which he mentioned in his book Shoe Dog, “If you are following your calling, the fatigue will be easier to bear, disappointments will be fuel, the highs will be like nothing you’ve ever felt.”

Tune down on your weaknesses and lean in on your strengths.
