Brief Summary</h2>\n<p>A book on investment legends. William Green is a well-known financial journalist and has access to many of the world's best investors. He shares lessons learned from his interviews of superinvestors. The book is filled with gems of wisdom and clonable concepts. If emulating these investors to become rich is nice in theory but tough to execute, emulating the way they live to become happy might not work even in theory because of their cold and difficult personalities. Nonetheless, the lessons can be fine tuned to lead a great investing and personal life.</p>\n<h2>II. Big Ideas</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Many of the investors talk about how they have created systems to mitigate risk but every system is doomed to fail because there is so much randomness that it can drive you insane.</li>\n<li>The lessons shared can also be conflicting because some invest almost all of their money in just a few stocks, but that’s contrary to the advice given by Benjamin Graham (value investor legend), who says diversification is key.</li>\n<li>Investors covererd in this book—some well known and others heard for the first time:\n<ul>\n<li>Sir John Templeton</li>\n<li>Irving Kahn</li>\n<li>Bill Ruane</li>\n<li>Marty Whitman</li>\n<li>Jack Bogle</li>\n<li>Charlie Munger</li>\n<li>Ed Thorp</li>\n<li>Howard Marks</li>\n<li>Joel Greenblatt</li>\n<li>Bill Miller</li>\n<li>Mohnish Pabrai</li>\n<li>Tom Gayner</li>\n<li>Guy Spier</li>\n<li>Fred Martin</li>\n<li>Ken Shubin Stein</li>\n<li>Matthew McClennan</li>\n<li>Jeffrey Gundlach</li>\n<li>Francis Chou</li>\n<li>Thyra Zerhusen</li>\n<li>Thomas Russo</li>\n<li>Chuck Akre</li>\n<li>Li Lu</li>\n<li>Pat Dorsey</li>\n<li>Michael Price</li>\n<li>Mason Hawkins</li>\n<li>Bill Ackman</li>\n<li>Jeff Vinik</li>\n<li>Mario Gabelli</li>\n<li>Laura Geritz</li>\n<li>Brian McMahon</li>\n<li>Henry Ellenbogen</li>\n<li>Donald Yacktman</li>\n<li>Bill Nygren</li>\n<li>Paul Lountzis</li>\n<li>Jason Karp</li>\n<li>Will Danoff</li>\n<li>François Rochon</li>\n<li>John Spears</li>\n<li>Joel Tillinghast</li>\n<li>Nick Sleep &#x26; Qais Zakaria</li>\n<li>Paul Isaac</li>\n<li>Mike Zapata</li>\n<li>Paul Yablon</li>\n<li>Whitney Tilson</li>\n<li>Francois-Marie Wojcik</li>\n<li>Sarah Ketterer</li>\n<li>Christopher Davis</li>\n<li>Raamdeo Agrawal</li>\n<li>Arnold Van Den Berg</li>\n<li>Mariko Gordon</li>\n<li>Jean-Marie Eveillard</li>\n<li>Guy Spier</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>III. Quotes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Everything is on a path to fade. — Matthew McLennan</li>\n<li>Most people make the mistake of adding too much complexity to their lives. They skim the surface, preoccupying themselves with the superficial and the extraneous. As the best investors show, sustained excellence requires us to subtract and go deep.</li>\n<li>If you’re going to be in this game for the long pull, which is the way to do it, you better be able to handle a fifty percent decline without fussing too much about it. And so my lesson to all of you is, conduct your life so that you can handle the fifty percent decline with aplomb and grace. Don’t try to avoid it. It will come. In fact, I would say if it doesn’t come, you’re not being aggressive enough.</li>\n<li>Munger has also learned to control certain toxic emotions that would corrode his enjoyment of life. “Crazy anger. Crazy resentment. Avoid all that stuff,” he tells me. “I don’t let it run. I don’t let it start.” The same goes for envy, which he considers the dumbest of the seven deadly sins because it’s not even fun. He also disdains the tendency to view oneself as a victim, and he has no patience for whining. When I ask if he has a mental process that helps him to defuse self-defeating emotions, he replies, “I know that anger is stupid. I know that resentment is stupid. I know self-pity is stupid. So I don’t do them....I’m trying not to be stupid every day, all day.</li>\n<li>You get a lot of A’s and B’s in school. In the stock market, you get a lot of F’s. And if you’re right six or seven times out of ten, you’re very good.</li>\n<li>All of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone.</li>\n<li>I feel wealthier not because I have more money but because I’ve got health, good friendships, I’ve got a great family. Prosperity takes all of these things into consideration: health, wealth, happiness, peace of mind. That’s what a prosperous person is, not just a lot of money. That doesn’t mean anything. – Van Den Berg</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If all you succeed in doing in life is getting rich by buying little pieces of paper, it’s a failed life. Life is more than being shrewd in wealth accumulation. — Charlie Munger</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It’s frightening to think that you might not know something, but more frightening to think that, by and large, the world is run by people who have faith that they know exactly what’s going on.</li>\n<li>If you just go around and identify all of the disasters and say, ‘What caused that?’ and try to avoid it, it turns out to be a very simple way to find opportunities and avoid troubles.</li>\n<li>I don’t have any wonderful insights that other people don’t have. I just have slightly more consistently than others avoided idiocy. Other people are trying to be smart. All I’m trying to be is non-idiotic. I find that all you have to do to get ahead in life is to be non-idiotic and live a long time. It’s harder to be non-idiotic than most people think.</li>\n<li>Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life. Think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.</li>\n<li>The Art of Subtraction—If there is one habit that all of the investors in this chapter have in common, it’s this: They focus almost exclusively on what they’re best at and what matters most to them. Their success derives from this fierce insistence on concentrating deeply in a relatively narrow area while disregarding countless distractions that could interfere with their pursuit of excellence. Jason Zweig, an old friend who is a personal finance columnist at the Wall Street Journal and the editor of a revised edition of The Intelligent Investor, once wrote to me, “Think of Munger and Miller and Buffett: guys who just won’t spend a minute of time or an iota of mental energy doing or thinking about anything that doesn’t make them better....Their skill is self-honesty. They don’t lie to themselves about what they are and aren’t good at. Being honest with yourself like that has to be part of the secret. It’s so hard and so painful to do, but so important.</li>\n<li>Once you have a sense that life is meaningless, what should you do? Not fuck up life for other people. Leave the planet a better place than you found it. Do a good job with your kids. The rest of it is a game. It doesn’t matter.</li>\n<li>The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.</li>\n<li>How to prepare for the future instead of fooling ourselves into believing we can predict it.</li>\n<li>In a world where nothing is stable or dependable and almost anything can happen, the first rule of the road is to be honest with ourselves about our limitations and vulnerabilities.</li>\n<li>Fragility comes in many forms.</li>\n<li>The ideal amount to give your kids is enough so they can do anything, but not so much that they can do nothing.</li>\n<li>Templeton, Soros, and Buffett share “the willingness to be lonely, the willingness to take a position that others don’t think is too bright. They have an inner conviction that a lot of people do not have.”– Michael Lipper</li>\n<li>A necessary characteristic of great investors is that they can’t be overly influenced by what other people think. The easiest way not to be overly influenced by what other people think is not to be that aware of what they think. If you don’t really notice that and don’t really care about what other people think, that will make it easier to be a great investor. — Chris Davis</li>\n<li>If you’re even a slightly above average investor who spends less than you earn, over a lifetime you cannot help but get very wealthy. — Buffett</li>\n<li>You don’t have to swing at everything—you can wait for your pitch. The problem when you’re a money manager is that your fans keep yelling, ‘Swing, you bum!’ — Warren Buffett</li>\n<li>We, and our judgment, and all mortal things go on flowing and rolling unceasingly. Thus nothing certain can be established about one thing by another, both the judging and the judged being in continual change. — Michel De Montaigne</li>\n<li>The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook. — William James</li>\n<li>To attain knowledge, add things every day. To attain wisdom, subtract things every day. — Lao-tzu</li>\n<li>Uncertainty compels diversification. Diversification is and always has been the first tenet of the Prudent Man Rule of Investing....In sub-Saharan Africa, for centuries, people believed cattle were the safest repository of wealth. That was until the great drought came along. — Barton Biggs</li>\n<li>The stock market is a sadistic, contrary, changeable beast and nothing is forever. — Barton Biggs</li>\n<li>The crucial question is whether the investor will, in fact, hold on. The problem is not in the market, but in ourselves, our perceptions, and our reactions to our perceptions. This is why it is so important for each client to develop a realistic knowledge of his own and/or his organization’s tolerance for market fluctuations. — Charles Ellis</li>\n<li>The only thing we can really count on in this uncertain world is human unreliability itself. — Garrett Harden</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Richer, Wiser, Happier | How The World's Greatest Investors Win In Markets And Life by William Green","date":"December 07, 2024","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/on-artificial-intelligence/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"On Artificial Intelligence"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"2399556c-a6e1-597e-9828-d42886bc2a63","previousPostId":"15f50cf0-6fef-556c-b63f-c446560733ff","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["3204476847"],"slicesMap":{}}
