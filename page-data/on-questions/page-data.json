Those who ask great questions possess the key to genuine curiosity. Question is a powerful tool to learn anything. If I ask enough questions, I am certainly positive that I can trace back to the first question ever asked, but that is an exercise for never.</p>\n<h2>What is a question?</h2>\n<p>My interest lies on how to master the art of asking quality questions to learn anything in life. But what is a question? Wikipedia describes it as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A question is an utterance which typically functions as a request for information, which is expected to be provided in the form of an answer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wikipedia goes on further that at linguistically level, a question can be defined on three levels:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>At the level of semantics, a question is defined by its ability to establish a set of logically possible answers.</li>\n<li>At the level of pragmatics, a question is an illocutionary category of speech act which seeks to obtain information from the addressee.</li>\n<li>At the level of syntax, the interrogative is a type of clause which is characteristically associated with questions, and defined by certain grammatical rules.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>On the last point, questions are often conflated with interrogatives, which are the grammatical forms typically used to achieve them. Rhetorical questions, for example, are interrogative in form but may not be considered true questions as they are not expected to be answered.</p>\n<p>The purpose of this deep dive is to explore open-ended questions for better conversations and drive personal growth for curious people.</p>\n<h2>What is a quality question?</h2>\n<p>What is the purpose of asking high quality questions? A quality question “reframes” the knowledge allowing to build further conviction or “refactors” an existing belief. It allows you to think about the current information and finding the gaps which triggers further questions. Most questions would never change your existing mental models or body of knowledge, but great quality questions will allow you to question your current beliefs which then allows you to adapt your beliefs over time.</p>\n<p>If you are reading a murder novel, asking “who was the murderer?” is a less fruitful question than “why did the dogs in the house didn't bark?” The second question is a good indicator of a curious mind. The first question alone is less directional towards the answer. A good question cuts to the heart of anomaly, the answer to which would crack the larger problem open.</p>\n<h2>Socratic method</h2>\n<p>The trial of Socrates was a controversial case because the citizen of Athens knew him as an intellectual and moral citizen of their society. However, Socrates was sentenced to death due to the consequence of asking politico-philosophic questions of his students. Plato captured the presentation of the trial and death of Socrates that inspired many people. Plato called him “the wisest and most just of all men” who demonstrated the defects of democracy.</p>\n<p>The Socratic approach to questioning has stood the test of time. The Socratic method is an effective way to explore ideas in depth.  It is based on the practice of disciplined, thoughtful dialogue. In this technique, the teacher professes ignorance of the topic in order to engage in dialogue with the students. With this “acting dumb,” the student develops the fullest possible knowledge about the topic.</p>\n<p>Teachers promote independent thinking in their students and give them ownership of what they are learning. Higher-level thinking skills are present while students think, discuss, debate, evaluate, and analyze content through their own thinking and the thinking of those around them. Socratic method is used in many disciplines and institutions including the US Supreme Court.</p>\n<p>In Plato's early dialogues, the <em>elenchus</em> is the technique Socrates uses to investigate, for example, the nature or definition of ethical concepts such as justice or virtue.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Socrates' interlocutor asserts a thesis, for example, “Courage is endurance of the soul.”</li>\n<li>Socrates decides whether the thesis is false and targets for refutation.</li>\n<li>Socrates secures his interlocutor’s agreement to further premises, for example “Courage is a fine thing” and “Ignorant endurance is not a fine thing.”</li>\n<li>Socrates then argues, and the interlocutor agrees, these further premises imply the contrary of the original thesis; in this case, it leads to, “Courage is not endurance of the soul.”</li>\n<li>Socrates then claims he has shown his interlocutor's thesis is false, and its negation is true.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The essential component of the Socratic method uses questions to examine the values, principles, and beliefs of people. The Socratic method focuses on moral education, on how one ought to live. The Socratic method demands a classroom environment characterized by productive discomfort. The Socratic method is better used to demonstrate complexity, difficulty, and uncertainty than at eliciting facts about the world.</p>\n<h2>Paul Graham on questions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Few grasp this. One of the biggest misconceptions about new ideas is about the ratio of question to answer in their composition. People think big ideas are answers, but often the real insight was in the question.</li>\n<li>Part of the reason we underrate questions is the way they're used in schools. In schools they tend to exist only briefly before being answered, like unstable particles. But a really good question can be much more than that. A really good question is a partial discovery. How do new species arise?</li>\n<li>Unanswered questions can be uncomfortable things to carry around with you. But the more you're carrying, the greater the chance of noticing a solution — or perhaps even more excitingly, noticing that two unanswered questions are the same.</li>\n<li>Sometimes you carry a question for a long time. Great work often comes from returning to a question you first noticed years before — in your childhood, even — and couldn't stop thinking about. People talk a lot about the importance of keeping your youthful dreams alive, but it's just as important to keep your youthful questions alive.</li>\n<li>This is one of the places where actual expertise differs most from the popular picture of it. In the popular picture, experts are certain. But actually the more puzzled you are, the better, so long as (a) the things you're puzzled about matter, and (b) no one else understands them either.</li>\n<li>You have to be comfortable enough with the world being full of puzzles that you're willing to see them, but not so comfortable that you don't want to solve them.</li>\n<li>It's a great thing to be rich in unanswered questions. And this is one of those situations where the rich get richer, because the best way to acquire new questions is to try answering existing ones. Questions don't just lead to answers, but also to more questions.</li>\n<li>The best questions grow in the answering. You notice a thread protruding from the current paradigm and try pulling on it, and it just gets longer and longer. So don't require a question to be obviously big before you try answering it. You can rarely predict that. It's hard enough even to notice the thread, let alone to predict how much will unravel if you pull on it.</li>\n<li>It's better to be promiscuously curious — to pull a little bit on a lot of threads, and see what happens. Big things start small. The initial versions of big things were often just experiments, or side projects, or talks, which then grew into something bigger. So start lots of small things.</li>\n<li>Being prolific is underrated. The more different things you try, the greater the chance of discovering something new. Understand, though, that trying lots of things will mean trying lots of things that don't work. You can't have a lot of good ideas without also having a lot of bad ones.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Warren Berger on questions</h2>\n<p>I am a member of <a href=\"http://ltcwrk.com/\">LTCWRK</a> which is a community of curious people. Recently, a lecture was held by <a href=\"https://amorebeautifulquestion.com/\">Warner Berger</a> who is an author of several books on this particular topic. Some of my notes below from the lecture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are negative/dark side of questions:\n<ul>\n<li>Questions can be confrontational.</li>\n<li>Questioning authority can have consequences.</li>\n<li>Questions get used for a lot of purposes. Not all of them are good.\n<ul>\n<li>Someone with an agenda especially political figure with an agenda.</li>\n<li>They are not used for the purpose of learning but to drive an agenda which discourages an open debate.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Steve Jobs was the architect of questions. He used it as an everyday tool. He used the <em>philosophy</em> of Zen, the beginner’s mind which is to ask questions while emptying your mind. He used “why” every day to challenge himself and his employees to keep everyone on their toes.</li>\n<li>Questions reveal vulnerability. We ask less questions as we age. People (leaders) want to preserve their identity, age and authority so they don’t ask enough questions. Humility comes into play while asking questions.\n<ul>\n<li>Humility &#x26; confidence are both important elements of questions.</li>\n<li>You need confidence to ask questions, but you also need humility to be vulnerable to ask questions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Kids don’t have egos, but adults do which prevents them to ask questions. This is why kids are better.\n<ul>\n<li>It’s this tool that allows us to learn. It’s the question. What a beautiful thing.</li>\n<li>Kids are not afraid to use it. They are good at open-ended questions.</li>\n<li>But we can do something better than kids. We can moderate our questions that are less annoying.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>If you don’t ask questions, you are putting on an act.</li>\n<li>All innovation comes from big open-ended questions. Ask yourself, “what are some of the radical things we can do?”</li>\n<li>A good question has some element of curiosity. The way to determine if a question is authentic if it has the following elements:\n<ul>\n<li>Good faith</li>\n<li>Purpose of curiosity &#x26; learning</li>\n<li>Open mindedness</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Frameworks to use:\n<ul>\n<li>Sandwich framework\n<ul>\n<li>Start with “I am curious” then ask the question followed by providing a rationale for that question For example, “I am curious, why do we do [x]? I am asking because of [y] rational.”</li>\n<li>This is a great framework to ask questions. It gives the listener a warning, a 2-second warning, when you start with stating that you are curious and then providing a rational towards the end.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Self-taught questions are great to bring perspective in your personal life.\n<ul>\n<li>Shift your perspective when in situational events by asking, “what would [x] person do?” What would Abraham Lincoln do? What would a 90-year-old me do?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Constraint on-off questions\n<ul>\n<li>On: what would I do if I had 24 hours to live?</li>\n<li>Off: what would I do if I had all the budget in the world to build a product?\n<ul>\n<li>AirBnB uses this a lot while defining user experience. “What would an 11/10 experience look like?” Of course, not feasible, but allows learning about all the possibilities by exploring open-ended questions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Questions are great to break mental traps, biases and prejudices based on past-experiences. We are wired in this way since the beginning of our days. So a tool like this is super helpful to break the conditioning. Use self-taught questions to understand these self-constructed biases. This is called critical thinking.\n<ul>\n<li>Business leaders are overconfident in their gut decisions, but science disagrees. Spend time avoiding your gut reaction by asking open-ended questions.</li>\n<li>Avoid recency bias when asking questions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>A good practice exercise is to journal about the most important question of the day.</li>\n<li>Question requires solving for a puzzle which our brains are wired to do. Don’t try to get answers immediately. Think deep and broad to solve it.</li>\n<li>Don’t lead with questions with pre-meditated answers or outcomes. They are not good for learning and exploring. However, they do have a place:\n<ul>\n<li>They have a role while teaching others especially in education space. Teachers do it a lot.</li>\n<li>Socrates did that during his trial with pupils.</li>\n<li>Even people with agenda do it. Be careful.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Types of questions</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Leading question</strong>: A leading question cannot be answered by a simple “Yes” or “No.” It requires the person you're interacting with to utter more than one syllable. Often, once you get the momentum of an answer going, the person will continue talking. Another key is to be curious. A genuinely interesting question will get a boat loads of love because people love feeling respected for their opinion and knowledge.</li>\n<li><strong>Closed question</strong>: A closed question is a question that has only one answer. For example: “Do you file your taxes?” You will most likely get a response “Yes” or “No.”  All closed questions lead to a tense atmosphere since it narrows the space for a partner to have a conversation with. It also has a purpose when you are trying to obtain an agreement, but less fruitful when you are trying to explore something. This is useful when you are trying to get an agreement from your significant other to go on a date. It'd be less useful if the other person goes on a tangent before answering a yes or a no.</li>\n<li><strong>Open question</strong>: An open question is a question that requires some explanation and implies a detailed answer. You can use the open questions to get additional information or find out the real motives of the interlocutor. Often, such questions begin with words: <em>why</em>, <em>what or</em> <em>how</em>. Open-ended questions bring the partner you are having a conversation with in an active state and eliminates the barriers.</li>\n<li><strong>Rhetorical questions</strong>: A rhetorical question is a question that does not require a direct answer and is aiming of focusing their attention or pointing out unsolved problems. For example: “Are we holding a common opinion on this issue?” or “When do people finally learn to understand each other?” Proceed with caution as it is easy to slip into the dark side of questions.</li>\n<li><strong>Alternative question</strong>: An alternative question is an open question with several pre-prepared answers. For example: “When do you think is better to hold the next meeting? Can we meet this week again or the next one?” To talk more to the interlocutor, you can use the alternative questions. However, it is recommended to soften the alternative questions that may offend feelings of the interlocutor. For example, instead of the question, “What are you afraid of that is preventing you to get work done?” use the following, “Are there some circumstances that will prevent you from doing work on time?”</li>\n<li><strong>Provocative questions</strong>: Provocative questions can catch the interlocutor on the contradiction between what he says now and what he has said earlier. To use such type of questions is not the best way to gain authority. At best, your partner (or opponent) will look for revenge. This type leads to the dark side of questioning.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Question bank</h2>\n<p>Here is my ridiculously long list of good questions accumulated over the years from the internet, blogs, podcasts and personal notes.

What is our business model? That's strategy. The how questions are: how are we going to behave? How are we going to operate as an organization and as a team?
