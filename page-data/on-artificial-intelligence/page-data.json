There is no doubt we are living in the age of AI as all walks of life are being transformed by machine learning and artificial intelligence. We are already seeing the impact of the field on social science including human experience and decision making.</p>\n<p>Here is my attempt to deep dive on the topic of AI without claiming any future predictions.</p>\n<p>Bold statements come flying high every second on deeming computers intelligent. Whether they are intelligent enough to save us or kill us, I am not sure, but it is worth exploring the meaning of <em>intelligence</em> before diving deeper into <em>machines</em>.</p>\n<h2>Human Intelligence</h2>\n<p><strong>What does it mean to be an intelligent human?</strong></p>\n<p>Cognitive science is a vast field with different dichotomies in intelligence—consciousness, thinking (deliberative vs non-deliberative), reflexive behavior, language (semantic), perception, feelings, thought, common sense, learning (children), recollection, comprehension, competence and reasoning and generalization. Intelligence is embodiment of these other complex systems.</p>\n<p>Humans are not born pre-programmed with a set of instructions that we deem intelligent. Intelligence is a collection of repetitive exercise and adaptive behavior overtime and the learnings are reinforced by failure and success as a form of feedback. This feedback mechanism shapes our human behavior and intelligence.</p>\n<p>The counter argument can be made that our DNA is coded with instructions passed on to us from our ancestors. But then how come an infant not hold a spoon to feed itself when they enter the world? An extreme example but the point here is even though we enter the world with genetic code instructions in our DNA, learning is necessary for survival. Humans do not experience pre-programmed paradigm like the computers do.</p>\n<p>Another thing to note about our environment is the causal relationships—some things make other things happen which enables one to learn how the surroundings work. The cause and effect shapes our  behavior. For example, picking a hot cup of coffee and dropping it on the floor made the carpet wet. Another example is moon affects the tides on our oceans.</p>\n<p>The cause and effect is important in science and learning because we analyze data based on experiments. We modify one tiny thing to see what happens. This is how babies learn. They are constantly experimenting by interacting with their environment. Some pre-programming from DNA helps shape personality and behavior, but majority of the learning comes from experimenting constantly which is how they learn.</p>\n<p>As the learning reinforces by interacting with their environment, adaptive behavior takes shape without thinking too much. For example your motor flexes when entering an elevator due to the shift in gravity (elevator acting against gravity while going up). You don't think about how you chew food. It is impossible to teach someone step by step as so many organs are involved. Daniel Dennett called this <em>competence with comprehension</em> and <em>competence without comprehension</em>. There is a lot of competence in the absence of comprehension within our species.</p>\n<p>This is what we call common sense which is another form of intelligence. It gives us basic assumptions that help us navigate this complex world. Experience and genetics collectively teaches us to do quick inferences. If you have a wider vehicle you know you cannot fit in a narrow alleyway. This is learned by having countless interactions  between physical experience, innate repository, thinking and rationalizing. And this combination of complex intelligent systems result in projecting assumptions to other things in life. This general awareness is what we mean by common sense.</p>\n<p>We observe causal relationships by interacting with physical environment, reinforcing motor reflexes and strengthening our common sense repository which some might call knowledge or intelligence.</p>\n<p><strong>Now that we have a basic understanding of intelligence, what is super intelligence?</strong></p>\n<p>As much as we desire a god like control over other species and our surroundings, we are able to fulfill this desire because human species come with curiosity and ability to communicate with language.</p>\n<p>No other species have we found thus far that cares deeply about why sky is blue or slowing down the decay of human organs so we can live longer. Our strong desire to learn about the world is what makes us super intelligent which has resulted in complex tooling and machinery. Our innate ability to search and explore is intrinsic because we know how babies operate. They are constantly experimenting, questioning and reasoning. As a parent I wonder how my kid picked things up which were never taught. This is human cognition at its finest.</p>\n<p>Then on the other side we use language that is far superior than other species in animal kingdom. I can communicate to my family how I feel. Not only am I able to learn what is going on around me or within me, but I am able to communicate to others about these environments. This cycle of computing your environment and communicating your feelings with others is another one of superpower of human species.</p>\n<p>This is what makes us conscious!</p>\n<p>But will each one of my cell care about how I feel? Will it wipe my tears or sing with me when I am joyful? As we know today, at a cellular level that does not happen. But human body as a collective has feelings because we experience it on a daily basis and we react to those emotions accordingly.</p>\n<p>Writing all this down using a language on a tool that was built by a co-human is a form of thinking. Able to borrow ideas and repurpose them with my own thoughts and analogies is another form of intelligence. This is what I think separates human intelligence from animal intelligence.</p>\n<p>This is my basic understanding of intelligence which is borrowed from other people's ideas listed in references.</p>\n<h2>Machine Intelligence</h2>\n<p>Can machines communicate their feelings?
