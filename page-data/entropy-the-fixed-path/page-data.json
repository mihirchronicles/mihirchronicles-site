What is happening?</p>\n<p>Life used to be simple. What happened?</p>\n<p>The wheel of time goes through its natural cycle—creation to destruction to rebirth, but we continue to fight the decay brought on by entropy.</p>\n<p>Entropy is the second law of thermodynamics. It states that entropy—the measure of disorder in a closed system is always increasing.</p>\n<p>Everything has a default state and energy will move to its non-default state. The universe is always drifting from a state of order to a state of disorder.</p>\n<p>The birth of a child (default state) to turning a 30-year-old getting married (non-default state). The start of a company with 1 employee (default state) to a 300 people organization (non-default state). This is why the only constant in life is change.</p>\n<p>Yes, things used to be simple, but things are now chaotic because entropy is always increasing resulting in complexity.</p>\n<p>If chaos is the law of nature then order is the dream of humanity. Order does not create growth, chaos does.</p>\n<p>Befriend entropy, don't fight it.</p>\n<p>Complexity is not an accident. It is the byproduct of a universal law—the second law of thermodynamics. You and I are both decaying and declining from our original state.
