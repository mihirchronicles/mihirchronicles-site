Neither does it care about a business plan nor a deadline.</p>\n<p>A bird just keeps building to lay its eggs.</p>\n<p>It starts building a nest by weaving together grass and twigs to form a basket and use binding material such as mud to hold its nest.</p>\n<p>But mother nature is unyielding to these gentle birds. The heavy storm, wind or hail brings the nest down with its forceful impact that is under construction.</p>\n<p>The bird watches the destruction from far. After the storm settles and the sun rises back again, so does the bird. It gets back to work.</p>\n<p>One weave at a time, with extra care, but with steady pace.</p>\n<p>The bird puts a great deal of time and attention into preparing for its approaching offspring.</p>\n<p>A clutch finally arrives, chicks get stronger, wings widen, and they are set free to soar on their own.</p>\n<p>And the bird shows up next year with same focus to do it all over again. This time too without a plan.</p>\n<p>A valuable lesson for us humans on how to build. The way to build a nest is by building a nest.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Bird That Keeps Building","date":"August 17, 2023","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/declare-do-repeat/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Declare Do Repeat"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/extreme-ownership/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Extreme Ownership | How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead & Win by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f07b1721-e9c8-5ab2-b5ab-df96ace2e4a9","previousPostId":"49af6e4e-6895-5931-b536-827228016edc","nextPostId":"9ae8afbc-2949-53a3-9eb9-6750400c3fac"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3204476847"],"slicesMap":{}}
